# delta_vote
Perl scripts that parses DGEQ data and produces coloured Google Earth's KML maps of vote differentials

Quick start
-----------
Use delta****.pl to produce output.kml files that can be opened with Google Earth to see the coloured vote differentials. The four stars reprensent the last two digits of the two years that are compared. For instance 1210 means that we are comparing 2012 with 2010 election results.

Gree coloured vote sections mean electoral gains compared to the other electoral year. Red coloured vote sections mean electoral lost compared to the other electoral year. The stronger the colour is, the stronger the gains/losses are. Click on vote sections to get further data information. Use Google Earth to zoom and get additionnal geographic data of targeted vote sections.
